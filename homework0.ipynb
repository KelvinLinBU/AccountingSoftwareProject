        "> But no car has exactly 90 miles per gallon, you can compute it's distance from the closest car's mpg and sort based on that. For example, if the closest car has 80 mpg, then the distance is 10 since the customer wanted 90 (90-80 = 10). If the closest car has 100 mpg, then the distance is respectively 10. You can then sort based on the distance, where the smaller distance is the more preferred.\n",

For all the other CarModels that do not match the one in the preferences, assign them a bigger number like 2. Then, sort based on the number you assigned to each CarModel. This way, the CarModel that matches the preference will be sorted first.\n",
