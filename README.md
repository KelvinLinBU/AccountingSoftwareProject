# AccountingSoftwareProject
This is my accounting software project written entirely in Python! It features a fully working balance sheet   which adds and updates entires into the balance sheet. It categorizes your account, and puts it in the correct section on the balance sheet. There is also a remove functionality, where you can remove an entry from the balance sheet. It calculates total assets, total liabilities, and total equities. It also has subsections in the balance sheet that house current assets, fixed assets, current liabilities, and long-term liabilities. It also makes sure that the balance sheet balances out at the end! This project is a work in progress, and I plan on adding more financial statements in the future!
